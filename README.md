# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! I adapted this project from this template available [here](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site/tree/main).

There are so many personal website templates out there and it's hard to pick one; Motivation is important here. I was motivated to make a personal website because

1) I want to showcase my personal and professional projects
2) I want to highlight my technical expertise/skills related to Software Development and myself as a whole
3) I want to have a unique, central hub for my online presence that isn't just a social media page AND I want to be able to customize it as I wish
4) I want to share my personal goals and hobbies
5) I want to share blog posts, tutorials, insights, opinions, ideas, etc as I please
6) Lots of developers build their website from scratch to display their skills. I, however, would rather adapt one and add my own touches as I develop and maintain it.

Therefore, I approached this project with the goal of not primarily demonstrating my front-end skills, but rather showcasing my ability to adapt, enhance, and maintain an existing project.
